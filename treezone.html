    I understand things better when I type them out. I`m typing them out <i>here</i> because I know at least one bored fuck will read the entire thing and come out stupider for it.

    <mark>ESSAY 1: RULES</mark><br><br>
    the most enjoyable rules to break are the small ones. and here is a small rule: "websites should be useful and user friendly"
    <br><br>
    fuck no. <mark>things made with passion should not be accessible to those who don`t care.</mark> everything doesn`t have to be a product. nobody I know is pretty enough to be in an advertisement. . .  and so what?

    <mark>ESSAY 2: LOVE</mark><br><br>
    love is a spectrum and not the gay `people` spectrum and neither `love on the spectrum` (10/10 show by the way) but the idea, alright, is that all human affection is a very long spectrum. a two 
    dimensional or even three dimensional spectrum, at least I hope it is because if `disgust` is somewhere between love and hate I`m in large trouble, though it`d explain a lot
    <br><br>
    anyways, love is a spectrum. or, I guess it`s more accurate to say <i>emotions</i> are a spectrum (ONE spectrum), and love is the tip (see: `the tip who loved me`). 
    <br><br>
    several people I have met have some kinda opinion of affection being in several stages. like you go up the stages and each one adds a different thing, and includes all the things of the 
    last. like sex. (see: `the love who tipped me`) I think this is <mark>wrong.</mark>

    <br><br>
    for example, some people love their parents more than their partners, and only some of them also want to have sex with their parents. 
    <br><br>
    for example, I love music more than anything on earth, and I only sometimes want to have sex with my guitar.

    I think it is this thinking which causes so many people to be lonely, mainly men. if the pinnacle of `love` is <i>`someone who will [l/k]ick my balls`</i> then you`re avoiding all of the other
    meaningful and fulfilling relationships you can have with all the other people in your life.
